# How to modify Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package applications and their dependencies, enabling consistent and reproducible deployment across different systems. Docker helps streamline the development process by providing a consistent and reproducible environment, simplifying setup and collaboration, and facilitating the deployment of Java applications with modified MySQL containers.

To modify the MySQL container from Docker for this service, follow the below steps:

1. Come to the MySQL directory location by `cd Docker/MySQL`.
2. Start cdontainer operation by `docker-compose up`. If you do not want to debug with logs and want to run it in the background, use `docker-compose up -d`.
